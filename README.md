# Map

## About

Create a JavaScript `map` function that works like Ruby's map method.  It should take an array as the first argument and a function to call with each element of the collection.

You can leverage the [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) method if you'd like.
